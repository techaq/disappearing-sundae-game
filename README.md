The Disappearing Sundae Game

Description:
"The Disappearing Sundae Game," is a delightful word-guessing game where players must guess ice cream flavors and toppings before the sundae melts away! As you dive into the world of frozen treats and brain-teasing puzzles, be prepared to tantalize your taste buds and challenge your word-solving skills.

Motivation:
"The Disappearing Sundae Game" is a passion project born from my love for both ice cream and puzzles. Combining my two favorite things, I was inspired by the fond memories of ice cream trucks from my childhood. The game aims to recreate the excitement and joy that those colorful and inviting ice cream trucks brought to my younger self.
